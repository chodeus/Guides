[^atv-plex-p7]: The Apple TV doesn't support Profile 7, according to several sources including the Infuse forum. They mention that it actually falls back to HDR10, but your TV will trigger Dolby Vision (DV). This is often referred to as fake DV.<br>
    Fake DV = Triggers DV on your devices but you're actually playing the HDR10 base layer.

    However, one of our team members tested it and his setup triggered DV on his TV and his AVR. We can't say for sure if this is fake DV or real DV.
[^atv-plex-p8]: The Apple TV doesn't support Profile 8, according to several sources including the Infuse forum. They mention that it actually falls back to HDR10, but your TV will trigger Dolby Vision (DV). This is often referred to as fake DV.

    Suppose you want a box that can run premium Android applications and CoreELEC. In that case, the best overall device is the Homatics Box R 4k Plus with its support for Dolby Vision including FEL and AV1 with a certified Android TV box. However, CoreELEC will run slower than the Ugoos and may not be able to decode some older Blu-ray movies as it does not support the VC1 codec.
[^homatics-dv-p7]: Can play both FEL and MEL DV P7 as well Single Track and Dual Track

[^roku-hdr10-fallback]: Fallback to HDR10
[^roku-hdr10plus]: Didn't get a test result for this HDR Format, but considering that it supports HDR10, it will fallback to HDR10. If it supports HDR10+ I don't know till someone is able to provide this info.
[^roku-eac3]: Audio is transcoded to E-AC3/DD+
[^roku-dts-hd-ma]: Audio is transcoded to AC3/DD

[^shield-pro-plex-dv-p7]: It should play Profile 7 releases without issues.<br>
    But:<br>
    FEL/MEL  will be played as single layer.<br>
    MEL means, the EL is just empty, so Profile 7 BL+MEL+RPU is totally identical to Profile 8 BL+RPU

[^ugoos-tested]: Supports Dolby Vision including FEL and 3D on CoreELEC -ng. They can decode 24fps VC-1 content using a software decoding. Somewhat faster than S905X4-J devices, but more expensive and lack hardware support for AV1. CoreELEC can be installed on the emmc and HS400 enabled which greatly reduces boot time and speeds up which greatly reduces boot time and speeds up the interface making it feel significantly faster than the S905X4.

    If you want the best media box to only run CoreELEC, then the Ugoos AM6b+ is the best box with its faster processor and the ability to install COREelec to the emmc with HS400, but it runs an older version of Android and sacrifices support for certified apps including Netflix and AV1. However, only the Ugoos AM6b+ can fully replace a disc-based player.
[^ugoos-dv-p7]: The AM6B+ can play both FEL and MEL DV P7 as well Single Track and Dual Track

[^zidoo-edid]: There are special consideration, where the audio setup will modify the EDID profile that gets send from the TV to the Zidoo, cutting some framerate/resolution combinations. In some cases this lead to a frame or two skipping every now and then, because the framerate of the video didn't match the TV.<br>
    See this thread on how to get the best EDID for your setup (even if this is not an issue for you, as there are other benefits):  <https://forum.zidoo.tv/index.php?threads/edid-thread-rtd1619bpd-players.96829/>

*[DV P5]: DV Profile 5. This is what comes with WEB-DL Dolby Vision releases without HDR10 fallback. (Incompatible devices will playback with blown out pinks and greens)
*[DV P7]: DV Profile 7. This is what comes with UHD Bluray Remuxes and UHD BluRay releases. These files will play on an Nvidia Shield Pro (2019), but on most other players will revert to the HDR10 fallback.
*[DV P8]: DV Profile 8. This is what comes with (Hybrid) WEB-DL (HULU), Hybrid UHD Remux, and UHD BluRay releases (all of which have HDR10 fallback). This works with several mainstream media players.
*[FEL]: DV Profile 7 with a Full Enhancement Layer. Found on many UHD BluRay Remuxes. Players that play DV P7 without FEL support ignore the enhancement layer and play the base layer with the DV metadata.
*[MEL]: DV Profile 7 with a Minimal Enhancement Layer. The enhancement layer is empty, so the picture is the same as DV Profile 8.
*[Hi10]: H.264 (AVC) High 10 profile, also called Hi10P. 10-bit H.264, common in older anime releases. Most hardware decoders can't play it, so it needs software decoding or a transcode.
*[ASS/SSA]: Advanced SubStation Alpha / SubStation Alpha subtitles, common in anime releases. Styled subtitles with fonts, colors and positioning. If the player can't render them, Plex burns them into the video, which forces a video transcode.
